30883352	TREM2 Variants and Neurodegenerative Diseases : A Systematic Review and Meta - Analysis .|TREM2 ( triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ) gene variants were reported to increase the risk of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and even other neurodegenerative diseases ( frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) , Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) ) , but so far , no definite conclusion has been drawn .|The aim of our systematic review and meta - analysis was to investigate the role of TREM2 variants in neurodegenerative diseases .|A total of 39 papers ( including 26 case - control studies and 13 case reports ) were retrieved from PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane library in this study .|A fixed effect model was used to pool results in the analysis .|Three variants in TREM2 ( rs75932628 ( R47H ) , rs2234255 ( H157Y ) , and rs143332484 ( R62H ) ) were significantly associated with AD risk , but the similar associations between rs104894002 ( Q33X ) , rs2234253 ( T96K ) , rs142232675 ( D87N ) , rs2234256 ( L211P ) , and AD were not proven .|Rs75932628 also increased risk of PD in North Americans and FTD , but not PD in Europeans or ALS .|In the systematic review , 12 biallelic TREM2 mutations ( e . g . , rs104894002 , rs201258663 ( T66M ) , and rs386834144 , etc . ) have been described to cause Polycystic Lipomembranous Osteodysplasia with Sclerosing Leukoencephalopathy ( PLOSL ) in 14 families .|And homozygous mutations also have been reported to cause FTD without typical bone phenotypes in 7 families .|This study demonstrates that multiple variants in TREM2 have association with the onset of AD , FTD , and PD in North Americans and also play a key role in the phenotypes of the rare familial genetic disorder .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	151-152	96-98	rs75932628	rs75932628|R47H|Rs75932628	SNP	151:153:205	152:154:206	5:5:6	D019636	Neurodegenerative Diseases|neurodegenerative

30883505	Circulating Cell - Free DNA - Diagnostic and Prognostic Applications in Personalized Cancer Therapy .|Genomic analyses in oncologic care allow for the development of more precise clinical laboratory tests that will be critical for personalized pharmacotherapy .|Traditional biopsy - based approaches are limited by the availability of sequential tissue specimens to detect resistance .|Blood - based genomic profiling ( " liquid biopsy " ) is useful for longitudinal monitoring of tumor genomes and can complement biopsies .|Tumor - associated mutations can be identified in cell - free tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) from patient blood samples and used for monitoring disease activity .|The US Food and Drug Administration approved a liquid biopsy test for EGFR - activating mutations in patients with non - small - cell lung cancer as a companion diagnostic for therapy selection .|ctDNA also allows for the identification of mutations selected by treatment such as EGFR T790M in non -

30902917	Genomic Signature of Driver Genes Identified by Target Next - Generation Sequencing in Chinese Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer .|BACKGROUND : Non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is one of the most common human malignancies and the leading cause of cancer - related death .|Over the past few decades , genomic alterations of cancer driver genes have been identified in NSCLC , and molecular testing and targeted therapies have become standard care for lung cancer patients .|Here we studied the unique genomic profile of driver genes in Chinese patients with NSCLC by next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) assay .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 1 , 200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study .|The median age was 60 years ( range : 26 - 89 ) , and 83 % cases were adenocarcinoma .|NGS - based genomic profiling of major lung cancer - related genes was performed on formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tumor samples and matched blood .|RESULTS : Approximately 73 . 9 % of patients with NSCLC harbored at least one actionable alteration recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline , including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , ALK , ERBB2 , MET , BRAF , RET , and ROS1 .|Twenty - seven patients ( 2 . 2 % ) harbored inherited germline mutations of cancer susceptibility genes .|The frequencies of EGFR genomic alterations ( both mutations and amplification ) and ALK rearrangement were identified as 50 . 1 % and 7 . 8 % in Chinese NSCLC populations , respectively , and significantly higher than the Western population .|Fifty - six distinct uncommon EGFR mutations other than L858R , exon19del , exon20ins , or T790M were identified in 18 . 9 % of patients with EGFR - mutant NSCLC .|About 7 . 4 % of patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations , and 11 . 6 % of patients harbored only uncommon EGFR mutations .|The uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK , CDKN2A , NTRK3 , TSC2 , and KRAS .|In patients < 40 years of age , the ALK - positive percentage was up to 28 . 2 % .|Moreover , 3 . 2 % of ALK - positive patients harbored multi ALK rearrangements , and seven new partner genes were identified .|CONCLUSION : More unique features of cancer driver genes in Chinese NSCLC were identified by next - generation sequencing .|These findings highlighted that NGS technology is more feasible and necessary than other molecular testing methods , and suggested that the special strategies are needed for drug development and targeted therapy for Chinese patients with NSCLC .|IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE : Molecular targeted therapy is now the standard first - line treatment for patients with advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .|Samples of 1 , 200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were analyzed through next - generation sequencing to characterize the unique feature of uncommon EGFR mutations and ALK fusion .|The results showed that 7 . 4 % of EGFR - mutant patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations and 11 . 6 % harbored only uncommon mutations .|Uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK , CDKN2A , NTRK3 , TSC2 , and KRAS .|ALK fusion was more common in younger patients , and the frequency decreased monotonically with age .|3 . 2 % of ALK -

30920401	Fluvastatin exerts an antitumor effect in vemurafenib - resistant melanoma cells .|Although vemurafenib has been shown to improve the overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation , its efficacy is often hampered by drug resistance acquired within a relatively short period through several distinct mechanisms .|In the present study , we investigated the effect of fluvastatin as a possible strategy to overcome such acquired resistance using a cultured cell line model .|We established vemurafenib - resistant ( VR ) cells from three BRAF ( V600E ) - mutated melanoma lines ( C32 , HMY - 1 , and SK - MEL - 28 ) and evaluated the mechanism of acquired resistance of VR cells by water - soluble tetrazolium salts assay , western blot , real - time quantitative PCR , and immunofluorescent microscopy .|The efficacy of the combination of growth inhibitory effect of vemurafenib and fluvastatin on respective parental and VR cells were assessed by calculating combination index and western blot .|IC50 values of three VR cells were ~5 - 100 - fold higher than those for the respective parental cells .|The VR cells derived from HMY - 1 and SK - MEL - 28 showed constitutive activation of AKT kinase , and the specific AKT inhibitor MK - 2208 or the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin increased the cellular sensitivity to vemurafenib .|Intriguingly , application of a statin - related drug , fluvastatin , also resulted in a synergistic increase of sensitivity to vemurafenib in the VR cells ( combination index : 0 . 73 - 0 . 86 ) probably by alleviating constitutive AKT activation , whereas the same treatment did not notably alter the vemurafenib sensitivity of the parental cells .|Our results suggest the possible usefulness of statin - related drugs for overcoming vemurafenib resistance acquired through constitutive activation of the PI3K - AKT axis .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	30-31	26-27	rs113488022	V600E|V600E	ProteinMutation	30:92	31:93	1:3	D008545	melanoma|melanoma|melanoma	Disease	9:26:96	10:27:97	0:1:3	673	None

30924609	AGK - BRAF is associated with distant metastasis and younger age in pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma .|BACKGROUND : The incidence of thyroid carcinoma has increased in most populations , including pediatric patients .|The increase is almost exclusively due to an increase in the incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) .|Genetic alterations leading to mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway activation are highly prevalent in PTC , with BRAF V600E mutation being the most common event in adult PTC .|Although a lower prevalence of BRAF V600E had been reported among pediatric patients , a higher prevalence of BRAF fusion has been identified in both radiation - exposed and sporadic pediatric PTC .|However , little is known about the prognostic implications of BRAF fusions in pediatric PTC .|PROCEDURE : In this study , we investigated the prevalence of BRAF alterations ( AGK - BRAF fusion and BRAF V600E mutation ) in a large set of predominantly sporadic pediatric PTC cases and correlate with clinicopathological features .|Somatic AGK - BRAF fusion was investigated by RT - PCR and confirmed by FISH break - apart .|The BRAF V600E mutation was screened using Sanger sequencing .|RESULTS : AGK - BRAF fusion , found in 19 % of pediatric PTC patients , was associated with distant metastasis and younger age .|Conversely , the BRAF V600E , found in 15 % of pediatric PTC patients , was correlated with older age and larger tumor size .|CONCLUSION : Collectively , our results advance knowledge concerning genetic bases of pediatric thyroid carcinoma , with potential implications for diagnosis , prognosis , and therapeutic approaches .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	76-77	72-73	rs113488022	V600E|V600E|V600E|V600E|V600E	ProteinMutation	76:93:156:196:233	77:94:157:197:234	3:4:6:8:10	D000077273	papillary thyroid carcinoma|papillary thyroid carcinoma|PTC|PTC|PTC|PTC|PTC|PTC|PTC|PTC	Disease	13:47:51:72:85:118:134:167:217:241	16:50:52:73:86:119:135:168:218:242	0:2:2:3:3:4:5:6:9:10	673	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	267-269	233-234	rs113488022	V600E|V600E|V600E|V600E|V600E	ProteinMutation	76:93:156:196:233	77:94:157:197:234	3:4:6:8:10	D013964	thyroid carcinoma|thyroid carcinoma	Disease	22:267	24:269	1:11	673	None	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	233-234	251-252	rs113488022	V600E|V600E|V600E|V600E|V600E	ProteinMutation	76:93:156:196:233	77:94:157:197:234	3:4:6:8:10	D009369	tumor	Disease	251	252	10	673	None
30925032	The combination of whole - exome sequencing and clinical analysis allows better diagnosis of rare syndromic retinal dystrophies .|PURPOSE : To identify the accurate clinical diagnosis of rare syndromic inherited retinal diseases ( IRDs ) based on the combination of clinical and genetic analyses .|METHODS : Four unrelated families with various autosomal recessive syndromic inherited retinal diseases were genetically investigated using whole - exome sequencing ( WES ) .|RESULTS : Two affected subjects in family MOL0760 presented with a distinctive combination of short stature , developmental delay , congenital mental retardation , microcephaly , facial dysmorphism and retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) .|Subjects were clinically diagnosed with suspected Kabuki syndrome .|WES revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation ( c . 5492dup , p . Asn1831Lysfs * 8 ) in VPS13B that is known to cause Cohen syndrome .|The index case of family MOL1514 presented with both RP and liver dysfunction , suspected initially to be related .|WES identified a homozygous frameshift mutation ( c . 1787_1788del , p . His596Argfs * 47 ) in AGBL5 , associated with nonsyndromic RP .|The MOL1592 family included three affected subjects with crystalline retinopathy , skin ichthyosis , short stature and congenital adrenal hypoplasia , and were found to harbour a homozygous nonsense mutation ( c . 682C > T , p . Arg228Cys ) in ALDH3A2 , reported to cause Sjogren - Larsson syndrome ( SLS ) .|In the fourth family , SJ002 , two siblings presented with hypotony , psychomotor delay , dysmorphic facial features , pathologic myopia , progressive external ophthalmoplegia and diffuse retinal atrophy .|Probands were suspected to have atypical Kearns - Sayre syndrome , but were diagnosed with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency - 20 due to a novel suspected missense variant ( c . 1691C > T , p .

30927072	LRRK2 modifies alpha - syn pathology and spread in mouse models and human neurons .|Progressive aggregation of the protein alpha - synuclein ( alpha - syn ) and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta ( SNpc ) are key histopathological hallmarks of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|Accruing evidence suggests that alpha - syn pathology can propagate through neuronal circuits in the brain , contributing to the progressive nature of the disease .|Thus , it is therapeutically pertinent to identify modifiers of alpha - syn transmission and aggregation as potential targets to slow down disease progression .|A growing number of genetic mutations and risk factors has been identified in studies of familial and sporadic forms of PD .|However , how these genes affect alpha - syn aggregation and pathological transmission , and whether they can be targeted for therapeutic interventions , remains unclear .|We performed a targeted genetic screen of risk genes associated with PD and parkinsonism for modifiers of alpha - syn aggregation , using an alpha - syn preformed - fibril ( PFF ) induction assay .|We found that decreased expression of Lrrk2 and Gba modulated alpha - syn aggregation in mouse primary neurons .|Conversely , alpha - syn aggregation increased in primary neurons from mice expressing the PD - linked LRRK2 G2019S mutation .|In vivo , using LRRK2 G2019S transgenic mice , we observed acceleration of alpha - syn aggregation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc , exacerbated degeneration - associated neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits .|To validate our findings in a human context , we established a novel human alpha - syn transmission model using induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPS ) - derived neurons ( iNs ) , where human alpha - syn PFFs triggered aggregation of endogenous alpha - syn in a time - dependent manner .|In PD subject - derived iNs , the G2019S mutation enhanced alpha - syn aggregation , whereas loss of LRRK2 decreased aggregation .|Collectively , these findings establish a strong interaction between the PD risk gene LRRK2 and alpha - syn transmission across mouse and human models .|Since clinical trials of LRRK2 inhibitors in PD are currently underway , our findings raise the possibility that these may be effective in PD broadly , beyond cases caused by LRRK2 mutations .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	227-228	223-224	rs34637584	G2019S|G2019S|G2019S	ProteinMutation	227:235:327	228:236:328	8:9:11	D010300	Parkinson 's disease|PD|PD|PD|PD|PD|PD|PD|PD	Disease	47:51:125:165:223:320:352:374:390	50:52:126:166:224:321:353:375:391	1:1:4:6:8:11:12:13:13	120892	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	227-228	167-168	rs34637584	G2019S|G2019S|G2019S	ProteinMutation	227:235:327	228:236:328	8:9:11	D010302	parkinsonism	Disease	167	168	6	120892	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	235-236	257-264	rs34637584	G2019S|G2019S|G2019S	ProteinMutation	227:235:327	228:236:328	8:9:11	D001523	degeneration - associated neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits	Disease	257	264	9	120892	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	327-328	339-341	rs34637584	G2019S|G2019S|G2019S	ProteinMutation	227:235:327	228:236:328	8:9:11	D007022	decreased aggregation	Disease	339	341	11	120892	None

30946460	A synonymous VHL variant in exon 2 confers susceptibility to familial pheochromocytoma and von Hippel - Lindau disease .|CONTEXT : von Hippel - Lindau disease , comprising renal cancer , hemangioblastoma and / or pheochromocytoma ( PHEO ) is caused by missense or truncating variants of the VHL tumor suppressor gene , which is involved in degradation of hypoxia inducible factors ( HIFs ) .|However , the role of synonymous VHL variants in the disease is unclear .|OBJECTIVE : We evaluated a synonymous VHL variant in patients with familial PHEO or VHL disease without a detectable pathogenic VHL mutation .|DESIGN : We performed genetic and transcriptional analyses of leukocytes and / or tumors from affected and unaffected individuals and evaluated VHL splicing in existing cancer databases .|RESULTS : We identified a synonymous VHL variant ( c . 414A > G , p . Pro138Pro ) as the driver event in five independent individuals / families with PHEOs or VHL syndrome .|This variant promotes exon 2 skipping and , hence , abolishes expression of the full - length VHL transcript .|Exon 2 spans the HIF binding domain , required for HIF degradation by VHL .|Accordingly , PHEOs carrying this variant display HIF hyperactivation typical of VHL loss .|Moreover , other exon 2 VHL variants from the TCGA pan - cancer datasets are biased toward expression of a VHL transcript that excludes this exon , supporting a broader impact of this spliced variant .|CONCLUSION : A recurrent synonymous VHL variant ( c . 414A > G , p . Pro138Pro ) confers susceptibility to PHEO and VHL disease through splice disruption , leading to VHL dysfunction .|This finding indicates that certain synonymous VHL variants may be clinically relevant and should be considered in genetic testing and surveillance settings .|The observation that other coding VHL variants can exclude exon 2 suggests that dysregulated splicing may be an underappreciated mechanism in VHL - mediated tumorigenesis .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	140-145	10-12	rs869025648	c . 414A > G|p .

30965071	Pluripotent stem cell - derived bile canaliculi - forming hepatocytes to study genetic liver diseases involving hepatocyte polarity .|BACKGROUND & AIMS : Hepatocyte polarity is essential for the development of bile canaliculi and for safely transporting bile and waste products from the liver .|Functional studies of autologous mutated proteins in the context of the polarized hepatocyte have been challenging because of the lack of appropriate cell models .|The aims of this study were to obtain a patient - specific hepatocyte model that recapitulated hepatocyte polarity and to employ this model to study endogenous mutant proteins in liver diseases that involve hepatocyte polarity .|METHODS : Urine cell - derived pluripotent stem cells , taken from a patient with a homozygous mutation in ATP7B and a patient with a heterozygous mutation , were differentiated towards hepatocyte - like cells ( hiHeps ) .|HiHeps were also derived from a patient with MEDNIK syndrome .|RESULTS : Polarized hiHeps that formed in vivo - like bile canaliculi could be generated from embryonic and patient urine cell - derived pluripotent stem cells .|HiHeps recapitulated polarized protein trafficking processes , exemplified by the Cu2 + - induced redistribution of the copper transporter protein ATP7B to the bile canalicular domain .|We demonstrated that , in contrast to the current dogma , the most frequent yet enigmatic Wilson disease - causing ATP7B - H1069Q mutation per se did not preclude trafficking of ATP7B to the trans - Golgi Network .|Instead , it prevented its Cu2 + - induced polarized redistribution to the bile canalicular domain , which could not be reversed by pharmacological folding chaperones .|Finally , we demonstrate that hiHeps from a patient with MEDNIK syndrome , suffering from liver copper overload of unclear etiology , showed no defect in the Cu2 + - induced redistribution of ATP7B to the bile canaliculi .|CONCLUSIONS : Functional cell polarity can be achieved in patient pluripotent stem cell - derived hiHeps , enabling , for the first time , the study of the endogenous mutant proteins , patient - specific pathogenesis and drug responses for diseases where hepatocyte polarity is a key factor .|LAY SUMMARY : This study demonstrates that cells that are isolated from urine can be reprogrammed in a dish towards hepatocytes that display architectural characteristics similar to those seen in the intact liver .|The application of this methodology to cells from patients diagnosed with inherited copper metabolism - related liver diseases ( that is , Wilson disease and MEDNIK syndrome ) revealed unexpected and novel insights into patient mutation - specific disease mechanisms and drug responses .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	232-233	99-101	rs76151636	H1069Q	ProteinMutation	232	233	8	D008107	liver diseases|liver diseases|inherited copper metabolism - related liver diseases	Disease	13:99:409	15:101:416	0:3:13	540	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	232-233	226-228	rs76151636	H1069Q	ProteinMutation	232	233	8	D006527	Wilson disease|Wilson disease	Disease	226:420	228:422	8:13	540	None

30968502	The nonsense mutation MSH2 c . 2152C > T shows a founder effect in Portuguese Lynch syndrome families .|The mutational spectrum of the MMR genes is highly heterogeneous , but specific mutations are observed at high frequencies in well - defined populations or ethnic groups , due to founder effects .|The MSH2 mutation c . 2152C > T , p . ( Gln718 * ) , has occasionally been described in Lynch families worldwide , including in Portuguese Lynch syndrome families .|During genetic testing for Lynch syndrome at the Portuguese Oncology Institutes of Porto and Lisbon , this mutation was identified in 28 seemingly unrelated families .|In order to evaluate if this alteration is a founder mutation , haplotype analysis using microsatellite and SNP markers flanking the MSH2 gene was performed in the 28 probands and 87 family members .|Additionally , the geographic origin of these families was evaluated and the age of the mutation estimated .|Twelve different haplotypes were phased for 13 out of the 28 families and shared a conserved region of ~3 . 6 Mb .|Based on the mutation and recombination events observed in the microsatellite haplotypes and assuming a generation time of 25 years , the age estimate for the MSH2 mutation was 273 + - 64 years .|The geographic origins of these families were mostly from the Northern region of Portugal .|Concluding , these results suggest that the MSH2 c . 2152C > T alteration is a founder mutation in Portugal with a relatively recent origin .|Furthermore , its high proportion indicates that screening for this mutation as a first step , together with the previously reported Portuguese founder mutations , may be cost - effective in genetic testing of Lynch syndrome suspects of Portuguese ancestry .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-9	15-17	rs587779139	c . 2152C > T|c . 2152C > T|c . 2152C > T	DNAMutation	4:55:243	9:60:248	0:2:9	D003123	Lynch syndrome|Lynch syndrome|Lynch syndrome|Lynch syndrome	Disease	15:80:88:295	17:82:90:297	0:2:3:10	4436	None

31223037	Cost - effectiveness of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination as adjuvant treatment of BRAF V600E / K mutation - positive melanoma from a US healthcare payer perspective .|Objective : The COMBI - AD trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination vs placebo as adjuvant treatment of patients with BRAF V600E / K mutation - positive resected Stage IIIA ( lymph node metastasis > 1 mm ) , IIIB , or IIIC melanoma .|This analysis evaluated the cost - effectiveness of dabrafenib and trametinib vs observation from a US healthcare payer perspective . Methods : This evaluation employed a non - homogeneous , semi - Markov , cohort model with health states for relapse - free survival ( RFS ) , post - locoregional recurrence ( LR ) , post - distant recurrence ( DR ) receiving first - line treatment , and post - DR receiving second - line treatment .|A 50 - year modeling time horizon was used .|Transition probabilities were estimated based on individual patient data ( IPD ) from the COMBI - AD trial .|Health - state utilities were estimated using EuroQol ( EQ - 5D ) index values from COMBI - AD and published sources .|Direct medical costs associated with treatment of melanoma were considered , including costs of BRAF mutation testing , medication and administration costs for adjuvant and metastatic treatments , costs of treating recurrence , and costs of adverse events .|Costs and quality - adjusted life - years ( QALYs ) were discounted at 3 . 0 % annually . Results : Compared with observation , adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib was estimated to result in a gain of 2 . 15 QALYs at an incremental cost of $ 74 , 518 .|The incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) was estimated to be $ 34 , 689 per QALY .|In deterministic sensitivity analyses , the ICER was sensitive to the cost of dabrafenib and trametinib and the distribution used for projecting RFS beyond the end of follow - up in the COMBI - AD trial .|At a cost - effectiveness threshold of $ 100 , 000 per QALY , the probability that dabrafenib and trametinib is cost - effective was estimated to be 92 % . Conclusions : Given generally - accepted cost - effectiveness threshold values in the US , dabrafenib plus trametinib is likely to be a cost - effective adjuvant therapy for patients with BRAF mutation positive melanoma .|These results may be useful for policy - makers in their deliberations regarding reimbursement and access to this treatment .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	14-17	20-21	rs113488022	V600E / K|V600E / K	ProteinMutation	14:55	17:58	0:1	D008545	melanoma|IIIC melanoma|melanoma|melanoma	Disease	20:76:217:423	21:78:218:424	0:1:6:10	673	None

31261387	Functionalization of the TMEM175 p . M393T variant as a risk factor for Parkinson disease .|Multiple genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) in Parkinson disease ( PD ) have identified a signal at chromosome 4p16 . 3 ; however , the causal variant has not been established for this locus .|Deep investigation of the region resulted in one identified variant , the rs34311866 missense SNP ( p . M393T ) in TMEM175 , which is 20 orders of magnitude more significant than any other SNP in the region .|Because TMEM175 is a lysosomal gene that has been shown to influence alpha - synuclein phosphorylation and autophagy , the p . M393T variant is an attractive candidate , and we have examined its effect on TMEM175 protein and PD - related biology .|After knocking down each of the genes located under the GWAS peak via multiple shRNAs , only TMEM175 was found to consistently influence accumulation of phosphorylated alpha - synuclein ( p - alpha - syn ) .|Examination of the p . M393T variant showed effects on TMEM175 function that were intermediate between the wild - type ( WT ) and knockout phenotypes , with reduced regulation of lysosomal pH in response to starvation and minor changes in clearance of autophagy substrates , reduced lysosomal localization , and increased accumulation of p - alpha - syn .|Finally , overexpression of WT TMEM175 protein reduced p - alpha - syn , while overexpression of the p . M393T variant resulted in no change in alpha - synuclein phosphorylation .|These results suggest that the main signal in the chromosome 4p16 . 3 PD risk locus is driven by the TMEM175 p .

31292011	Systematic review of genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in Parkinson 's disease .|OBJECTIVE : Cognitive impairment and depression are among the most prevalent and most disabling non - motor symptoms in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|The genetic factors that are associated with these symptoms remain uncertain .|This systematic review aims to summarise the prevailing evidence from all genetic association studies investigating the genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in people with PD .|METHOD : A systematic review using five online databases : PubMed , PsycINFO , CINAHL , EMBASE and OpenGrey ( PROSPERO protocol : CRD42017067431 ) .|We completed the quality assessment using the Q - Genie tool .|RESULTS : 2353 articles were screened , and 43 articles were found to be eligible to be included .|A meta - analysis of studies investigating LRRK2 rs34637584 confirmed that the minor allele carriers had significantly less cognitive impairment ( p = 0 . 015 ) .|Further meta - analyses showed that GBA variants rs76763715 ( p < 0 . 001 ) and rs421016 ( p = 0 . 001 ) were significantly associated with more cognitive impairment in people with PD .|Minor alleles of GBA variants rs76763715 , rs421016 , rs387906315 and rs80356773 were associated with more depressive symptoms in PD .|Moreover , APOE epsilon4 allele has been associated with more cognitive impairment in PD .|BDNF ( rs6265 ) and CRY1 ( rs2287161 ) variants have been associated with more depressive symptoms in people with PD .|CONCLUSIONS : PD carriers of GBA variants are at high risk for cognitive decline and depression .|Screening for these variants may facilitate early identification and effective management of these non - motor symptoms .|The molecular mechanisms underlying favourable cognitive functioning in LRRK2 rs34637584 variant carriers warrant further investigation

31296159	The effect of CFTR modulators on a cystic fibrosis patient presenting with recurrent pancreatitis in the absence of respiratory symptoms : a case report .|BACKGROUND : Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is a genetic disorder of the epithelial CFTR apical chloride channel resulting in multi - organ manifestations , including pancreatic exocrine secretion .|In the pancreas , CFTR abnormality results in abnormally viscous secretions that obstruct proximal ducts leading to fibrotic injury and ultimately pancreatic insufficiency in 85 % of the CF population .|CFTR modulators , including the potentiator ivacaftor , augment channel gating to restore 30 - 50 % of CFTR - mediated anion transport .|While CFTR modulation has been shown to alkalinize the pH of the alimentary tract and potentially augment pancreatic enzyme activity , the effect of ivacaftor on recurrent pancreatitis is emerging .|Here we describe a case of a patient with CF ( R117H / 7 T / F508del ) who presented with recurrent pancreatitis who was effectively treated with ivacaftor in the absence of respiratory symptoms .|CASE PRESENTATION : A 24 - year - old white male with past medical history of recurrent acute pancreatitis presented for evaluation following a referral from an outside hospital .|The patient reported a lifetime of gastrointestinal symptoms requiring over 20 hospitalizations for pancreatitis in the last 10 years .|Prior U / S and CT imaging for pancreatitis ruled out gallstones or anatomical etiologies .|Family history included a brother with CF carrier status who suffered from recurrent acute pancreatitis .|Sweat chloride testing was suggestive of CFTR dysfunction ( 57 mmol / L ) .|Genetic testing demonstrated disease causing CFTR mutations : R1117H / 7 T / F508del .|Patient was prescribed pancrelipase , however , he reported worsened gas and diarrhea symptoms .|Pancrelipase was discontinued and the patient was prescribed ivacaftor 150 mg BID .|After 6 weeks of ivacaftor treatment , patient reported improved gastrointestinal symptoms .|For an additional 19 months , patient reported no episodes of pancreatitis until he discontinued ivacaftor .|Over the next 3 weeks , patient experienced progressive nausea and sharp epigastric pain and laboratory studies confirmed pancreatitis .|Patient was subsequently lost to follow up .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings support a possible relationship between the use of CFTR modulators , such as ivacaftor , in the management of recurrent pancreatitis in the setting of patients with cystic fibrosis and a CFTR mutation with residual CFTR activity or otherwise known to be responsive in vitro .|Ivacaftor may be useful for recurrent pancreatitis , even in the absence of respiratory morbidity .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	152-153	8-9	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D005355	fibrosis	Disease	8	9	0	1080	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	163-164	152-153	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D010195	pancreatitis|pancreatic|pancreatic|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatitis	Disease	13:51:127:137:163:195:220:235:257:341:365:399:431	14:52:128:138:164:196:221:236:258:342:366:400:432	0:1:4:4:5:6:7:8:9:15:16:18:19	1080	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	174-176	152-153	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D012818	respiratory symptoms|respiratory symptoms	Disease	18:174	20:176	0:5	1080	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	152-153	150-151	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D003550	Cystic fibrosis|CF|CF|CF|CF|cystic fibrosis	Disease	27:30:83:150:249:406	29:31:84:151:250:408	1:1:2:5:9:18	1080	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	152-153	34-36	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D030342	genetic disorder	Disease	34	36	1	1080	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	152-153	72-74	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D014947	fibrotic injury	Disease	72	74	2	1080	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	152-153	76-78	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D010188	pancreatic insufficiency	Disease	76	78	2	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	152-153	213-215	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D012817	gastrointestinal symptoms|gastrointestinal symptoms	Disease	213:327	215:329	7:14	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	152-153	238-239	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D042882	gallstones	Disease	238	239	8	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	152-153	265-267	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D009461	CFTR dysfunction	Disease	265	267	10	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	152-153	301-302	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D003967	diarrhea	Disease	301	302	12	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	152-153	356-357	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D009325	nausea	Disease	356	357	16	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	152-153	360-361	rs78655421	R117H	ProteinMutation	152	153	5	D010146	pain	Disease	360	361	16	1080	None

0 . 023 ) .|Moreover , the additional use of 8 genetic polymorphisms may increase both the sensitivity and specificity of GDM prediction by 10 % .|The results of this study indicate that the use of 8 genetic polymorphisms associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and type 2 diabetes [ PTGS2 ( COX2 ) rs6681231 , FADS1 rs174550 , HNF1B rs4430796 , ADIPOQ rs266729 , IL18 rs187238 , CCL2 rs1024611 , HHEX rs5015480 and CDKN2A / 2B rs10811661 ] together with clinical risk factors ( BMI and age ) may significantly improve the prediction of GDM .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	243-244	1-4	rs6681231	rs6681231	SNP	243	244	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-247	1-4	rs174550	rs174550	SNP	246	247	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	3992	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	249-250	1-4	rs4430796	rs4430796	SNP	249	250	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	6928	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	252-253	1-4	rs266729	rs266729	SNP	252	253	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	9370	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	255-256	1-4	rs187238	rs187238	SNP	255	256	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	3606	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	258-259	1-4	rs1024611	rs1024611	SNP	258	259	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	261-262	1-4	rs5015480	rs5015480	SNP	261	262	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	266-267	1-4	rs10811661	rs10811661	SNP	266	267	8	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes	Disease	1	4	0	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	243-244	237-238	rs6681231	rs6681231	SNP	243	244	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	246-247	237-238	rs174550	rs174550	SNP	246	247	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	3992	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	249-250	237-238	rs4430796	rs4430796	SNP	249	250	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	6928	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	252-253	237-238	rs266729	rs266729	SNP	252	253	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	9370	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	255-256	237-238	rs187238	rs187238	SNP	255	256	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	3606	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	258-259	237-238	rs1024611	rs1024611	SNP	258	259	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	261-262	237-238	rs5015480	rs5015480	SNP	261	262	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	266-267	237-238	rs10811661	rs10811661	SNP	266	267	8	D003920	Diabetes|diabetes	Disease	12:237	13:238	0:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	243-244	209-210	rs6681231	rs6681231	SNP	243	244	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	246-247	209-210	rs174550	rs174550	SNP	246	247	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	3992	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	284-285	249-250	rs4430796	rs4430796	SNP	249	250	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	6928	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	284-285	252-253	rs266729	rs266729	SNP	252	253	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	9370	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	284-285	255-256	rs187238	rs187238	SNP	255	256	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	3606	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	284-285	258-259	rs1024611	rs1024611	SNP	258	259	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	284-285	261-262	rs5015480	rs5015480	SNP	261	262	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	284-285	266-267	rs10811661	rs10811661	SNP	266	267	8	D016640	Gestational diabetes mellitus|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM|GDM	Disease	14:18:46:90:109:122:209:284	17:19:47:91:110:123:210:285	1:1:2:3:4:5:7:8	None	None

31347298	Biallelic germline BRCA1 mutations in a patient with early onset breast cancer , mild Fanconi anemia - like phenotype , and no chromosome fragility .|BACKGROUND : Biallelic BRCA1 mutations are regarded either embryonically lethal or to cause Fanconi anemia ( FA ) , a genomic instability syndrome characterized by bone marrow failure , developmental abnormalities , and cancer predisposition .|We report biallelic BRCA1 mutations c . 181T > G ( p . Cys61Gly ) and c . 5096G > A ( p . Arg1699Gln ) in a woman with breast cancer diagnosed at the age of 30 years .|The common European founder mutation p . Cys61Gly confers high cancer risk , whereas the deleterious p . Arg1699Gln is hypomorphic and was suggested to confer intermediate cancer risk .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Aside from significant toxicity from chemotherapy , the patient showed mild FA - like features ( e . g . , short stature , microcephaly , skin hyperpigmentation ) .|Chromosome fragility , a hallmark of FA patient cells , was not present in patient - derived peripheral blood lymphocytes .|We demonstrated that the p . Arg1699Gln mutation impairs DNA double - strand break repair , elevates RAD51 foci levels at baseline , and compromises BRCA1 protein function in protecting from replication stress .|Although the p . Arg1699Gln mutation compromises BRCA1 function , the residual activity of the p . Arg1699Gln allele likely prevents from chromosome fragility and a more severe FA phenotype .|CONCLUSION : Our data expand the clinical spectrum associated with biallelic BRCA1 mutations , ranging from embryonic lethality to a mild FA - like phenotype and no chromosome fragility .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	106-109	91-93	rs28897672	c . 181T > G|p .

31401654	Evaluating the associations between obesity and age - related cataract : a Mendelian randomization study .|BACKGROUND : The obesity - cataract association has been inconsistently reported .|The fat mass and obesity - related ( FTO ) single - nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs9939609 is a major SNP associated with obesity and has been used as an instrumental variable for obesity in a Mendelian randomization ( MR ) approach .|An interaction between the FTO SNP and macronutrient intake for obesity was suggested previously .|OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to assess the associations between obesity and cataract , using FTO SNP rs9939609 as an instrumental variable in an MR approach , and explore interactions of this SNP with macronutrient intake in relation to risk of cataract in a population - based cohort .|METHODS : The Blue Mountains Eye Study ( BMES ) is a longitudinal population - based study of common eye disease .|Of 3654 baseline participants of the BMES ( 1992 - 1994 ) , 2334 ( 75 . 8 % of survivors ) and 1952 ( 76 . 7 % of survivors ) were followed 5 and 10 y later .|During the 5 - y follow - up , 1174 new participants were examined .|Cumulative cataract was defined as the presence of cortical , nuclear , or posterior subcapsular ( PSC ) cataract at any visit , following the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System .|Imputed dosage of the FTO SNP rs9939609 was used .|Quintiles of macronutrient intake ( carbohydrates , protein , fats ) were derived from an FFQ .|ORs and 95 % CIs were estimated using multivariable - adjusted logistic regression models .|RESULTS : After multivariable adjustment , there were no associations between BMI and any cataract types in MR models using rs9939609 as an instrumental variable .|However , an interaction between rs9939609 and protein intake for PSC cataract risk was suggested ( P = 0 . 03 ) .|In analyses stratified by quintiles of protein intake , each minor allele of rs9939609 was associated with increased odds of PSC ( OR : 2 . 14 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 27 , 3 . 60 ) in the lowest quintile subgroup only .|CONCLUSIONS : Obesity was not causally associated with age - related cataract .|However , among persons in the lowest quintile of protein intake , obesity may be associated with PSC cataract .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	52-53	45-46	rs9939609	rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609	SNP	45:107:252:308:319:350	46:108:253:309:320:351	2:4:9:12:13:14	D009765	obesity|obesity - cataract|obesity|obesity|obesity|obesity|obesity|obesity	Disease	4:19:32:52:62:82:100:409	5:22:33:53:63:83:101:410	0:1:2:2:2:3:4:16	79068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	107-108	102-103	rs9939609	rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609	SNP	45:107:252:308:319:350	46:108:253:309:320:351	2:4:9:12:13:14	D002386	cataract|cataract|cataract|cataract|cataract|cataract|cataract|cataract|cataract	Disease	9:102:131:217:234:302:325:395:415	10:103:132:218:235:303:326:396:416	0:4:4:8:8:12:13:15:16	79068	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	107-108	157-160	rs9939609	rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609|rs9939609	SNP	45:107:252:308:319:350	46:108:253:309:320:351	2:4:9:12:13:14	D003139	common eye disease	Disease	157	160	5	79068	None
31401792	The grandfather 's fever .|An 86 - year - old Caucasian man had prior episodes of fever ( up to 38 C ) , mild abdominal pain , tachycardia , and malaise in the last 3 months , lasting 2 - 3 days .|He never suffered from abdominal or chest pain , rash , or arthralgia .|Major causes of fever were excluded ( pulmonary , urinary , abdomen , skin infections , neoplasms , and major rheumatologic disorders ) .|The patient was native of Altamura with a family history of familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) .|The genetic testing confirmed the presence of MEFV gene variants c . 442G > C ( E148Q ) on exon 2 and c . 2282G > A ( R761H ) on exon 10 , all in heterozygosity .|Mildly elevated serum transaminases suggested an ongoing form of FMF hepatitis on nonalcoholic liver steatosis .|The patient started colchicine 1 mg / day that induced symptom control and normalization of inflammatory markers , hyperbilirubinemia , and markers of cholestasis .|Symptoms of FMF can appear at any age in life and our patient represents a very late - onset clinical case .|The Apulian region has a consistent clustering of MEFV variants and FMF families with affected individuals in multiple consecutive generations .|Families show unique clinical features and rare signs of secondary amyloidosis without kidney damage .|Genetic and environmental bases of this phenotypic variant are under scrutiny .|Colchicine lifetime remains the mainstay of treatment in FMF patients .|KEY POINTS : Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is the most frequent hereditary monogenic recurrent fever syndrome , and symptoms can appear at any age in life .|Late - onset FMF approaches 30 % in late adulthood , but in general , onset of FMF after the age of 40 ( late onset FMF ) is rare , usually associated with M694V heterozygosity .|In a local cluster of FMF families ( Altamura , Puglia , Southern Italy ) , we report a very late - onset FMF ( variants E148Q , R761H ) in an 86 - year - old patient with a positive family history of FMF in two generations of descendants .|While lifetime colchicine remains the mainstay of treatment in FMF patients , prospective studies need to identify the characteristics of several phenotypic variants accounting for ( very ) - late onset FMF .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	111-116	62-63	rs3743930	c . 442G >

31403980	Genetic Variations at rs3129891 and rs77005575 are Associated With Reduced Expression of Enteric alpha - defensins in IBD Patients .|BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Human enteric antimicrobial peptides composed predominantly of human enteric alpha - defensins ( HD5 and HD6 ) are important in the mucosal antimicrobial barrier .|Previous studies have identified that genetic variations at rs2066844 , rs2066845 , rs2066847 are associated with diminished enteric alpha - defensins in ileal Crohn 's disease ( CD ) .|However , genetic variations associated with enteric antimicrobial peptides in colonic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) remain unclear .|To investigate it , we compared the colonic expression of antimicrobial peptides with respect to genotypes at 22 IBD - associated single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : In total , 16 controls and 102 colonic IBD patients including 42 ulcerative colitis ( UC ) and 60 CD were studies .|Mutation assay was performed to determine their genotypes at 22 IBD - associated SNPs .|Real - time PCR was performed to determine the colonic mRNA expression of HD5 , HD6 , lysozyme , and secretory phospholipase A2 .|RESULTS : Mutant genotypes at rs2066844 , rs2066845 , rs2066847 were not found , and only SNPs rs3129891 and rs77005575 were associated with enteric alpha - defensin expression in colonic IBD .|In both inflamed and noninflamed tissues , colonic expression of HD5 and HD6 was significantly decreased in UC and CD patients carrying rs3129891 homozygous mutant genotype .|And their colonic expression was significantly decreased in inflamed but not noninflamed tissues from UC patients carrying rs77005575 homozygous mutant genotype .|However , both lysozyme and secretory phospholipase A2 in UC and CD were unaffected by rs3129891 and rs77005575 genotypes .|CONCLUSIONS : As enteric alpha - defensins play critical roles in the mucosal antimicrobial barrier , their reduced expression may partly explain the microbial - induced mucosal inflammation in colonic IBD patients , especially in patients carrying rs3129891 and rs77005575 mutant genotypes

X618QextX * 14 ) , two splice mutations ( c . 34 + 5G > C and c . 405 + 3A > T ) and two missense mutations ( ETF : QO - p . Arg155Gly and ETF : QO - p .

Arg155Gly , all presented severe ( lethal ) MADD phenotypes .|However , when any of these mutations are in heterozygosity with the known ETF : QO - p . Pro534Leu mild variant , the severe clinical effects are partly and temporarily attenuated .|Indeed , the latter destabilizes an ETF - interacting loop , with no major functional consequences .|However , the position 155 in ETF : QO is localized at the ubiquinone binding and membrane interacting domain , and is thus expected to perturb protein structure and membrane insertion , with severe functional effects .|Structural analysis of molecular models is therefore demonstrated to be a valuable tool to rationalize the effects of mutations in the context of the clinical phenotype severity .|CONCLUSION : Advanced molecular diagnosis , structural analysis and clinical correlations reveal that MADD patients harboring a severe prognosis mutation in one allele can actually revert to a milder phenotype by complementation with a milder mutation in the other allele .|However , such patients are nevertheless in a precarious metabolic balance which can revert to severe fatal outcomes during catabolic stress or secondary pathology , thus requiring strict clinical follow - up .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	332-333	310-317	rs1373597092	c . 34 + 5G > C|c . 34 + 5G > C	DNAMutation	248:310	255:317	9:10	D054069	Multiple acyl - CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency|Multiple Acyl - CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency|MADD|MADD|MADD|MADD|MADD|MADD	Disease	8:17:24:139:148:221:332:463	14:23:25:140:149:222:333:464	0:1:1:4:5:8:10:15	2110	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	256-263	221-222	rs796051965	c . 405 + 3A > T	DNAMutation	256	263	9	D054069	Multiple acyl - CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency|Multiple Acyl - CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency|MADD|MADD|MADD|MADD|MADD|MADD	Disease	8:17:24:139:148:221:332:463	14:23:25:140:149:222:333:464	0:1:1:4:5:8:10:15	2110	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	332-333	322-325	rs549150456	p .

R518C model , CACNA1C - p . R518C hiPSC - CMs were generated from a 13 - year - old man ( QTc , > 480 ms ) with a family history of sudden cardiac death .|An isogenic hiPSC - CM gene - corrected control was created using CRISPR / Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats / clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat - associated 9 ) .|APD and calcium handling were assessed by live cell imaging with Arclight voltage and Fluo - 4 calcium indicators , respectively .|The APD and L - type calcium channel biophysical properties were further assessed by whole - cell patch clamp technique .|RESULTS : The Bazett formula - corrected , Arclight - measured APD90 of CACNA1C - p .

31455383	P53 - R273H mutation enhances colorectal cancer stemness through regulating specific lncRNAs .|BACKGROUND : TP53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes among all cancer types , and TP53 mutants occur more than 60 % in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .|Among all mutants , there are three hot spots , including p53 - R175H , p53 - R248W and p53 - R273H .|Emerging evidence attributes cancer carcinogenesis to cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) .|Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) play crucial roles in maintaining the stemness of CSCs .|However , it is unknown if mutant p53 - regulated lncRNAs are implicated in the maintenance of CSC stemness .|METHODS : RNA - sequencing ( RNA - seq ) and ChIP - sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) were used to trace the lncRNA network regulated by p53 - R273H in HCT116 endogenous p53 point mutant spheroid cells generated by the somatic cell knock - in method .|RT - qPCR was used to detect lncRNA expression patterns , verifying the bioinformatics analysis .|Transwell , spheroid formation , fluorescence activated cell sorter ( FACS ) , xenograft nude mouse model , tumor frequency assessed by extreme limiting dilution analysis ( ELDA ) , Western blot assays and chemoresistance analysis were performed to elucidate the functions and possible mechanism of lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 in cancer stem cells .|RESULTS : p53 - R273H exhibited more characteristics of CSC than p53 - R175H and p53 - R248W .|RNA - seq profiling identified 37 up regulated and 4 down regulated differentially expressed lncRNAs regulated by p53 - R273H .|Combined with ChIP - seq profiling , we further verified two lncRNAs , named as lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 , were essential in the maintenance of CSC stemness .|Further investigation illustrated that lnc273 - 31 or lnc273 - 34 depletion dramatically diminished colorectal cancer migration , invasion , cancer stem cell self - renewal and chemoresistance in vitro .|Moreover , the absence of lnc273 - 31 or lnc273 - 34 dramatically delayed cancer initiation and tumorigenic cell frequency in vivo .|Also , lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 have an impact on epithelial - to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .|Finally , lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 were significantly highly expressed in CRC tissues with p53 - R273H mutation compared to those with wildtype p53 .|CONCLUSIONS : The present study unveiled a high - confidence set of lncRNAs regulated by p53 - R273H specific in colorectal CSCs .|Furthermore , we demonstrated that two of them , lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 , were required for colorectal CSC self - renewal , tumor propagation and chemoresistance .|Also , the expression of these two lncRNAs augmented in colorectal cancer patient samples with p53 - R273H mutation .|These two lncRNAs may serve as promising predictors for patients with p53 - R273H mutation and are vital for chemotherapy .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	2-3	5-8	rs28934576	R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H	ProteinMutation	2:65:146:243:277:406:432:486:502	3:66:147:244:278:407:433:487:503	0:2:6:9:10:15:16:18:19	D015179	colorectal cancer stemness|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer	Disease	5:38:41:325:401:479	8:40:42:327:402:481	0:1:1:12:15:18	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	65-66	73-74	rs28934576	R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H	ProteinMutation	2:65:146:243:277:406:432:486:502	3:66:147:244:278:407:433:487:503	0:2:6:9:10:15:16:18:19	D009369	cancer|cancer|tumor|cancer|cancer|cancer|tumor	Disease	26:73:199:235:331:356:464	27:74:200:236:332:357:465	1:3:8:8:12:13:17	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	65-66	70-72	rs28934576	R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H	ProteinMutation	2:65:146:243:277:406:432:486:502	3:66:147:244:278:407:433:487:503	0:2:6:9:10:15:16:18:19	D063646	cancer carcinogenesis	Disease	70	72	3	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	57-58	41-42	rs28934578	R175H|R175H	ProteinMutation	57:252	58:253	2:9	D015179	colorectal cancer stemness|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer	Disease	5:38:41:325:401:479	8:40:42:327:402:481	0:1:1:12:15:18	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	61-62	41-42	rs121912651	R248W|R248W	ProteinMutation	61:256	62:257	2:9	D015179	colorectal cancer stemness|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer	Disease	5:38:41:325:401:479	8:40:42:327:402:481	0:1:1:12:15:18	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	73-74	57-58	rs28934578	R175H|R175H	ProteinMutation	57:252	58:253	2:9	D009369	cancer|cancer|tumor|cancer|cancer|cancer|tumor	Disease	26:73:199:235:331:356:464	27:74:200:236:332:357:465	1:3:8:8:12:13:17	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	73-74	61-62	rs121912651	R248W|R248W	ProteinMutation	61:256	62:257	2:9	D009369	cancer|cancer|tumor|cancer|cancer|cancer|tumor	Disease	26:73:199:235:331:356:464	27:74:200:236:332:357:465	1:3:8:8:12:13:17	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	57-58	70-72	rs28934578	R175H|R175H	ProteinMutation	57:252	58:253	2:9	D063646	cancer carcinogenesis	Disease	70	72	3	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	61-62	70-72	rs121912651	R248W|R248W	ProteinMutation	61:256	62:257	2:9	D063646	cancer carcinogenesis	Disease	70	72	3	7157	None
31456518	Identification of Phosphorylation Associated SNPs for Blood Pressure , Coronary Artery Disease and Stroke from Genome - wide Association Studies .|PURPOSE : Phosphorylation - related SNP ( phosSNP ) is a non - synonymous SNP that might influence protein phosphorylation status .|The aim of this study was to assess the effect of phosSNPs on blood pressure ( BP ) , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) and ischemic stroke ( IS ) .|METHODS : We examined the association of phosSNPs with BP , CAD and IS in shared data from genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) and tested if the disease loci were enriched with phosSNPs .|Furthermore , we performed quantitative trait locus analysis to find out if the identified phosSNPs have impacts on gene expression , protein and metabolite levels .|RESULTS : We found numerous phosSNPs for systolic BP ( count = 148 ) , diastolic BP ( count = 206 ) , CAD ( count = 20 ) and IS ( count = 4 ) .|The most significant phosSNPs for SBP , DBP , CAD and IS were rs1801131 in MTHFR , rs3184504 in SH2B3 , rs35212307 in WDR12 and rs3184504 in SH2B3 , respectively .|Our analyses revealed that the associated SNPs identified by the original GWAS were significantly enriched with phosSNPs and many well - known genes predisposing to cardiovascular diseases contain significant phosSNPs .|We found that BP , CAD and IS shared for phosSNPs in loci that contain functional genes involve in cardiovascular diseases , e . g . , rs11556924 ( ZC3HC1 ) , rs1971819 ( ICA1L ) , rs3184504 ( SH2B3 ) , rs3739998 ( JCAD ) , rs903160 ( SMG6 ) .|Four phosSNPs in ADAMTS7 were significantly associated with CAD , including the known functional SNP rs3825807 .|Moreover , the identified phosSNPs seemed to have the potential to affect transcription regulation and serum levels of numerous cardiovascular diseases - related proteins and metabolites .|CONCLUSION : The findings suggested that phosSNPs may play important roles in BP regulation and the pathological mechanisms of CAD and IS .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	188-189	184-185	rs1801131	rs1801131	SNP	188	189	6	D003324	Coronary Artery Disease|coronary artery

31482689	Whole - exome sequencing provides insights into monogenic disease prevalence in Northwest Russia .|BACKGROUND : Allele frequency data from large exome and genome aggregation projects such as the Genome Aggregation Database ( gnomAD ) are of ultimate importance to the interpretation of medical resequencing data .|However , allele frequencies might significantly differ in poorly studied populations that are underrepresented in large - scale projects , such as the Russian population .|METHODS : In this work , we leveraged our access to a large dataset of 694 exome samples to analyze genetic variation in the Northwest Russia .|We compared the spectrum of genetic variants to the dbSNP build 151 , and made estimates of ClinVar - based autosomal recessive ( AR ) disease allele prevalence as compared to gnomAD r .|2 . 1 .|RESULTS : An estimated 9 . 3 % of discovered variants were not present in dbSNP .|We report statistically significant overrepresentation of pathogenic variants for several Mendelian disorders , including phenylketonuria ( PAH , rs5030858 ) , Wilson 's disease ( ATP7B , rs76151636 ) , factor VII deficiency ( F7 , rs36209567 ) , kyphoscoliosis type of Ehlers - Danlos syndrome ( FKBP14 , rs542489955 ) , and several other recessive pathologies .|We also make primary estimates of monogenic disease incidence in the population , with retinal dystrophy , cystic fibrosis , and phenylketonuria being the most frequent AR pathologies .|CONCLUSION : Our observations demonstrate the utility of population - specific allele frequency data to the diagnosis of monogenic disorders using high - throughput technologies .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	173-174	165-167	rs5030858	rs5030858	SNP	173	174	7	D030342	autosomal recessive ( AR ) disease|Mendelian disorders	Disease	120:165	126:167	4:7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	182-183	165-167	rs76151636	rs76151636	SNP	182	183	7	D030342	autosomal recessive ( AR ) disease|Mendelian disorders	Disease	120:165	126:167	4:7	540	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	191-192	165-167	rs36209567	rs36209567	SNP	191	192	7	D030342	autosomal recessive ( AR ) disease|Mendelian disorders	Disease	120:165	126:167	4:7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	204-205	165-167	rs542489955	rs542489955	SNP	204	205	7	D030342	autosomal recessive ( AR ) disease|Mendelian disorders	Disease	120:165	126:167	4:7	55033	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	173-174	169-170	rs5030858	rs5030858	SNP	173	174	7	D010661	phenylketonuria|phenylketonuria	Disease	169:234	170:235	7:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	182-183	169-170	rs76151636	rs76151636	SNP	182	183	7	D010661	phenylketonuria|phenylketonuria	Disease	169:234	170:235	7:8	540	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	191-192	169-170	rs36209567	rs36209567	SNP	191	192	7	D010661	phenylketonuria|phenylketonuria	Disease	169:234	170:235	7:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	234-235	204-205	rs542489955	rs542489955	SNP	204	205	7	D010661	phenylketonuria|phenylketonuria	Disease	169:234	170:235	7:8	55033	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	173-174	176-179	rs5030858	rs5030858	SNP	173	174	7	D006527	Wilson 's disease	Disease	176	179	7	None	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	173-174	185-188	rs5030858	rs5030858	SNP	173	174	7	D005168	factor VII deficiency	Disease	185	188	7	None	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	173-174	194-201	rs5030858	rs5030858	SNP	173	174	7	D004535	kyphoscoliosis type of Ehlers -

31484543	N822K - or V560G - mutated KIT activation preferentially occurs in lipid rafts of the Golgi apparatus in leukemia cells .|BACKGROUND : KIT tyrosine kinase is expressed in mast cells , interstitial cells of Cajal , and hematopoietic cells .|Permanently active KIT mutations lead these host cells to tumorigenesis , and to such diseases as mast cell leukemia ( MCL ) , gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .|Recently , we reported that in MCL , KIT with mutations ( D816V , human ; D814Y , mouse ) traffics to endolysosomes ( EL ) , where it can then initiate oncogenic signaling .|On the other hand , KIT mutants including KITD814Y in GIST accumulate on the Golgi , and from there , activate downstream .|KIT mutations , such as N822K , have been found in 30 % of core binding factor - AML ( CBF - AML ) patients .|However , how the mutants are tyrosine - phosphorylated and where they activate downstream molecules remain unknown .|Moreover , it is unclear whether a KIT mutant other than KITD816V in MCL is able to signal on EL .|METHODS : We used leukemia cell lines , such as Kasumi - 1 ( KITN822K , AML ) , SKNO - 1 ( KITN822K , AML ) , and HMC - 1 . 1 ( KITV560G , MCL ) , to explore how KIT transduces signals in these cells and to examine the signal platform for the mutants using immunofluorescence microscopy and inhibition of intracellular trafficking .|RESULTS : In AML cell lines , KITN822K aberrantly localizes to EL .|After biosynthesis , KIT traffics to the cell surface via the Golgi and immediately migrates to EL through endocytosis in a manner dependent on its kinase activity .|However , results of phosphorylation imaging show that KIT is preferentially activated on the Golgi .|Indeed , blockade of KITN822K migration to the Golgi with BFA / M - COPA inhibits the activation of KIT downstream molecules , such as AKT , ERK , and STAT5 , indicating that KIT signaling occurs on the Golgi .|Moreover , lipid rafts in the Golgi play a role in KIT signaling .|Interestingly , KITV560G in HMC - 1 . 1 migrates and activates downstream in a similar manner to KITN822K in Kasumi - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : In AML , KITN822K mislocalizes to EL .|Our findings , however , suggest that the mutant transduces phosphorylation signals on lipid rafts of the Golgi in leukemia cells .|Unexpectedly , the KITV560G signal platform in MCL is similar to that of KITN822K in AML .|These observations provide new insights into the pathogenic role of KIT mutants as well as that of other mutant molecules .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	18-19	rs121913514	N822K|N822K	ProteinMutation	0:142	1:143	0:5	D007938	leukemia|leukemia|leukemia	Disease	18:206:434	19:207:435	0:8:16	3815	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	142-143	194-195	rs121913514	N822K|N822K	ProteinMutation	0:142	1:143	0:5	D007946	mast cell leukemia|MCL|MCL|MCL|MCL|MCL	Disease	57:61:85:194:239:444	60:62:86:195:240:445	2:2:3:7:8:17	3815	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	124-125	142-143	rs121913514	N822K|N822K	ProteinMutation	0:142	1:143	0:5	D046152	gastrointestinal stromal tumor|GIST|GIST	Disease	64:68:124	67:69:125	2:2:4	3815	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	142-143	155-156	rs121913514	N822K|N822K	ProteinMutation	0:142	1:143	0:5	D015470	acute myeloid leukemia|AML|AML|AML|AML|AML|AML|AML|AML	Disease	72:76:155:159:218:227:272:408:452	75:77:156:160:219:228:273:409:453	2:2:5:5:8:8:9:15:17	3815	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	142-143	385-391	rs121913514	N822K|N822K	ProteinMutation	0:142	1:143	0:5	C537632	HMC -

31491587	Potential complementation effects of two disease - associated mutations in tetrameric glutaryl - CoA dehydrogenase is due to inter subunit stability - activity counterbalance .|Glutaric Aciduria Type I ( GA - I ) , is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the GCDH gene that encodes for glutaryl - CoA dehydrogenase ( GCDH ) , a flavoprotein involved in the metabolism of tryptophan , lysine and hydroxylysine .|Although over 200 disease mutations have been reported a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype has been difficult to establish .|To contribute to a better molecular understanding of GA - I we undertook a detailed molecular study on two GCDH disease - related variants , GCDH - p . Arg227Pro and GCDH - p . Val400Met .|Heterozygous patients harbouring these two mutations have increased residual enzymatic activity in relation to homozygous patients with only one of the mutations , suggesting a complementation effect between the two .|Combining biochemical , biophysical and structural methods we here establish the effects of these mutations on protein folding , stability and catalytic activity .|We show that both variants retain the overall protein fold , but with compromised enzymatic activities .|Detailed enzyme kinetic studies reveal that GCDH - p . Arg227Pro has impaired function due to deficient substrate affinity as evidenced by its higher Km , and that the lower activity in GCDH - p . Val400Met results from weaker interactions with its physiological redox partner ( electron transfer flavoprotein ) .|Moreover , the GCDH - p . Val400Met variant has a significantly lower thermal stability ( DeltaTm 9 C ) , and impaired binding of the FAD cofactor in relation to wild - type protein .|On these grounds , we provide a rational for the possible interallelic complementation observed in heterozygous patients based on the fact that in GCDH , the low active p . Arg227Pro variant contributes to stabilize the tetramer while the structurally unstable p . Val400Met variant compensates for enzyme activity .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	120-123	101-104	rs121434373	p .

31604026	Changes in Airway Microbiome and Inflammation with Ivacaftor Treatment in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis and the G551D Mutation .|Rationale : Modulation of the cystic fibrosis ( CF ) transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein improves clinical outcomes in patients with CF and specific CFTR genetic mutations .|It remains unclear how improving CFTR function modifies existing airway infection and inflammation . Objectives : To compare sputum microbiome and markers of inflammation before and after 6 months of ivacaftor treatment . Methods : The study included 31 people with CF , ages 10 years and older , with at least one G551D CFTR allele and an forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) of 40 % predicted or greater who were enrolled in the GOAL ( G551D Observational ) study .|Sputum samples were collected either by induction ( n = 14 ) or by spontaneous expectoration ( n = 17 ) before and 6 months after initiation of ivacaftor .|Changes in bacterial community indices by sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons , total and specific bacterial load , and a panel of proteases , antiproteases , and inflammatory cytokines were determined . Results : The cohort that spontaneously expectorated sputum had a lower FEV1 , a higher proportion with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection , and higher concentrations of sputum inflammatory markers compared with the cohort that provided sputum by induction .|Although the overall cohort experienced significant improvements in FEV1 and reductions in sweat chloride , no significant changes in bacterial diversity , specific bacterial pathogens , or markers of inflammation were observed in these subjects .|Neither total bacterial load nor presence of Pseudomonas changed significantly between paired samples with ivacaftor treatment .|Younger patients experienced more shifts in their microbial communities than older patients . Conclusions : In this multicenter cohort , 6 months of ivacaftor treatment were not associated with significant changes in airway microbial communities or measures of inflammation .|These data suggest that concomitant antimicrobial and antiinflammatory treatments will still be needed to manage airway disease in patients with CF treated with highly effective CFTR modulator therapy , especially in older patients with more advanced disease .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	16-17	5-6	rs75527207	G551D|G551D|G551D	ProteinMutation	16:102:129	17:103:130	0:2:2	D007249	Inflammation|inflammation|inflammation|inflammation|inflammation	Disease	5:61:72:263:325	6:62:73:264:326	0:2:2:5:7	1080	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	16-17	12-14	rs75527207	G551D|G551D|G551D	ProteinMutation	16:102:129	17:103:130	0:2:2	D003550	Cystic Fibrosis	Disease	12	14	0	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	16-17	59-60	rs75527207	G551D|G551D|G551D	ProteinMutation	16:102:129	17:103:130	0:2:2	D007239	infection	Disease	59	60	2	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	129-130	214-216	rs75527207	G551D|G551D|G551D	ProteinMutation	16:102:129	17:103:130	0:2:2	D011552	aeruginosa infection	Disease	214	216	4	1080	None

31655222	Skeletal malformations and developmental arthropathy in individuals who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva .|RATIONALE : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ( FOP ) is primarily a disease of progressive heterotopic ossification ( HO ) leading to impaired mobility throughout life .|An additional diagnostic feature is a characteristic malformation of the great toes .|The culpable gene for FOP , ACVR1 ( activin A receptor type 1 ) has a clear effect on the induction of extra - skeletal bone formation .|However , this bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) pathway receptor is expressed widely throughout skeletal development and has a seminal role in axial and appendicular chondrogenesis , prompting suspicion of widespread bone and joint defects in those with ACVR1 mutations .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : We analyzed baseline whole body ( minus skull ) computed tomographic ( CT ) scans of 113 individuals with classic clinical features of FOP and the ACVR1 ( R206H ) mutation who were enrolled in a non - interventional natural history study ( ( NCT02322255 ) ) for skeletal malformations , atypical morphology , intra - articular synovial osteochondromatosis , developmental arthropathy , and associated degenerative joint phenotypes .|Individuals were evaluated in three age groups : 4 - 13 ; 14 - 25 ; and 25 - 56 years old , based on historical models of FOP disease progression .|RESULTS : We found widespread evidence of developmental arthropathy throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton in all age groups ( 61M , 52F ; ages : 4 - 56 years ) .|Asymmetric narrowing and subchondral sclerosis were present throughout the joints of the normotopic skeleton and osteophytes were common in the hips and knees of individuals who have FOP in all age groups .|The costovertebral joints , intervertebral facet joints , and proximal tibio - fibular joints frequently showed partial or total intra - articular ankylosis , particularly after age 13 .|The hips of FOP subjects are frequently malformed and dysplastic .|We also found evidence of degenerative joint phenotypes after age 13 , particularly in the spine , sacro - iliac joints , and lower limbs .|CONCLUSIONS : The effects of ACVR1 mutation on the normotopic skeletons of individuals who have FOP extend beyond malformation of the great toes and include both morphological defects and developmental arthropathy .|Associated degenerative joint disease occurring at multiple sites starts in adolescence and progresses throughout life .|These phenotypes appear to be uncoupled from heterotopic bone formation , indicating a potential role for ACVR1 in the development and progression of degenerative joint disease .|SIGNIFICANCE : FOP is a disease of not only progressive heterotopic ossification , but also widespread and extensive developmental arthropathy and associated degenerative joint disease .|These findings have relevance for understanding the natural history of FOP and for designing and evaluating clinical trials with emerging therapeutics .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	174-176	154-155	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D000014	Skeletal malformations|skeletal malformations|defects	Disease	0:174:385	2:176:386	0:5:12	90	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	186-188	154-155	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D007592	developmental arthropathy|joint defects|developmental arthropathy|degenerative joint|developmental arthropathy|degenerative joint|developmental arthropathy|developmental arthropathy	Disease	3:114:186:191:234:337:387:451	5:116:188:193:236:339:389:453	0:4:5:5:7:11:12:15	90	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	154-155	149-150	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D009221	fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva|Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva|FOP|FOP|FOP|FOP|FOP|FOP|FOP|FOP|FOP	Disease	9:15:19:56:149:223:286:324:373:435:469	12:18:20:57:150:224:287:325:374:436:470	0:1:1:3:5:6:8:10:12:15:16	90	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	154-155	30-31	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D009999	progressive heterotopic ossification|HO|heterotopic ossification	Disease	26:30:443	29:31:445	1:1:15	90	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	154-155	180-185	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D015838	intra - articular synovial osteochondromatosis	Disease	180	185	5	90	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	154-155	262-264	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D001845	subchondral sclerosis	Disease	262	264	8	90	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	154-155	293-295	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	C535781	costovertebral joints	Disease	293	295	9	90	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	154-155	311-315	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D057072	intra - articular ankylosis	Disease	311	315	9	90	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	154-155	330-331	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D004416	dysplastic	Disease	330	331	10	90	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	154-155	349-353	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D017543	sacro - iliac joints	Disease	349	353	11	90	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	154-155	391-394	rs121912678	R206H	ProteinMutation	154	155	5	D019636	degenerative joint disease|degenerative joint disease|degenerative joint disease	Disease	391:429:455	394:432:458	13:14:15	90	None

Conclusion : The overall characteristics of SAP deficiency in mainland China were consistent with those in previous reports , whereas manifestations of XIAP deficiency varied significantly .|None of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) has been reported among XIAP - deficient patients in our center ; however , whether Chinese XIAP - deficient patients will develop colitis in the future warrants further investigation .|HSCT is the only curative therapy for XLP and this therapy should be urgently considered . What is Known : SAP and XIAP deficiencies share common clinical feature , HLH , whereas they also have their own specific manifestations .|IBD affects 25 - 30 % of XIAP - deficient patients , which has been reported in other countries especially in European country and Japan . What is New : This is the largest patient cohort study of XLP in China .|We firstly summarized the clinical features and outcomes of Chinese XIAP - deficient patients and found only 1 in 22 patients developed IBD and diet background may contribute to it ; Asian SAP - deficient patients carrying SH2D1A R55X mutation were more prone to HLH .	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	526-527	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D008232	X - linked lymphoproliferative syndrome|X - linked lymphoproliferative syndrome|XLP|deficiency ( XLP1 ) and XIAP deficiency|XLP|XLP|XLP|XLP	Disease	0:19:25:42:68:93:455:526	5:24:26:49:69:94:456:527	0:1:1:1:2:2:14:15	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	30-33	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D000081207	primary immunodeficiency disease	Disease	30	33	1	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	568-569	540-543	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	C564469	XIAP deficiency|XIAP deficiency|XIAP - deficient|XIAP - deficient|XIAP - deficient|XIAP - deficient|XIAP deficiency|XIAP - deficient|XIAP - deficient|XIAP deficiencies|XIAP - deficient|XIAP - deficient	Disease	71:104:210:254:270:330:405:422:434:470:495:540	73:106:213:257:273:333:407:425:437:472:498:543	2:3:6:8:9:11:12:13:13:14:15:16	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	152-153	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D003643	died	Disease	152	153	5	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	574-575	568-569	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D051359	hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis|HLH|HLH|HLH	Disease	178:181:477:574	180:182:478:575	5:5:14:16	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	184-192	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D020031	Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) infection	Disease	184	192	6	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	305-306	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D000361	hypogammaglobulinemia|hypogammaglobulinemia	Disease	226:305	227:306	6:10	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	440-441	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D003092	colitis|colitis	Disease	259:440	260:441	8:13	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	261-262	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D008223	lymphoma	Disease	261	262	8	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	568-569	389-391	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	C567125	SAP deficiency	Disease	389	391	12	4068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	568-569	552-553	rs111033623	R55X	ProteinMutation	568	569	16	D015212	inflammatory bowel disease|IBD|IBD|IBD	Disease	412:416:488:552	415:417:489:553	13:13:15:16	4068	None

IMD MANTRA ORs ranged from 1 . 47 to 1 . 50 ; allergic disease METAL OR = 1 . 58 [ 1 . 20 - 2 . 08 ] ; allergic disease MANTRA ORs ranged from 1 . 55 to 1 . 59 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Some xenobiotic and immune response gene polymorphisms were shown here , for the first time , to have associations across a broad spectrum of IMD and ethnicities .|Our findings also suggest a role for ARNT in the development of autoimmune diseases , implicating environmental factors metabolized by this pathway in pathogenesis .|Further studies are needed to confirm these data , assess the implications of these findings , define gene - environment interactions , and explore the mechanisms leading to these increasingly prevalent disorders .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	286-288	281-282	rs11204735	rs11204735	SNP	281	282	7	D001327	autoimmune diseases|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune diseases	Disease	252:286:344:376:643	254:288:346:378:645	5:7:7:8:12	405	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	344-346	338-339	rs1889740	rs1889740	SNP	338	339	7	D001327	autoimmune diseases|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune diseases	Disease	252:286:344:376:643	254:288:346:378:645	5:7:7:8:12	405	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	376-378	371-372	rs2476601	rs2476601	SNP	371	372	8	D001327	autoimmune diseases|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune diseases	Disease	252:286:344:376:643	254:288:346:378:645	5:7:7:8:12	26191	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	408-409	376-378	rs3811021	rs3811021|rs3811021|rs3811021	SNP	408:490:522	409:491:523	9:10:10	D001327	autoimmune diseases|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune disease|autoimmune diseases	Disease	252:286:344:376:643	254:288:346:378:645	5:7:7:8:12	26191	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	281-282	255-257	rs11204735	rs11204735	SNP	281	282	7	D004342	allergic disorders|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	255:446:528:568:586	257:448:530:570:588	5:9:10:10:10	405	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	338-339	255-257	rs1889740	rs1889740	SNP	338	339	7	D004342	allergic disorders|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	255:446:528:568:586	257:448:530:570:588	5:9:10:10:10	405	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	446-448	371-372	rs2476601	rs2476601	SNP	371	372	8	D004342	allergic disorders|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	255:446:528:568:586	257:448:530:570:588	5:9:10:10:10	26191	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	528-530	522-523	rs3811021	rs3811021|rs3811021|rs3811021	SNP	408:490:522	409:491:523	9:10:10	D004342	allergic disorders|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	255:446:528:568:586	257:448:530:570:588	5:9:10:10:10	26191	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	281-282	258-259	rs11204735	rs11204735	SNP	281	282	7	D001249	asthma	Disease	258	259	5	405	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	338-339	258-259	rs1889740	rs1889740	SNP	338	339	7	D001249	asthma	Disease	258	259	5	405	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	371-372	258-259	rs2476601	rs2476601	SNP	371	372	8	D001249	asthma	Disease	258	259	5	26191	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	408-409	258-259	rs3811021	rs3811021|rs3811021|rs3811021	SNP	408:490:522	409:491:523	9:10:10	D001249	asthma	Disease	258	259	5	26191	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	281-282	261-264	rs11204735	rs11204735	SNP	281	282	7	D054990	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	Disease	261	264	5	405	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	338-339	261-264	rs1889740	rs1889740	SNP	338	339	7	D054990	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	Disease	261	264	5	405	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	371-372	261-264	rs2476601	rs2476601	SNP	371	372	8	D054990	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	Disease	261	264	5	26191	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	408-409	261-264	rs3811021	rs3811021|rs3811021|rs3811021	SNP	408:490:522	409:491:523	9:10:10	D054990	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	Disease	261	264	5	26191	None

31821471	Polymorphisms and endometriosis : a systematic review and meta - analyses .|BACKGROUND : Endometriosis is an estrogen - dependent gynecological disorder that affects at least 10 % of women of reproductive age .|It may lead to infertility and non - specific symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain .|Endometriosis screening and diagnosis are difficult and time - consuming .|Late diagnosis ( with a delay ranging from 3 . 3 to 10 . 7 years ) is a major problem and may contribute to disease progression and a worse response to treatment once initiated .|Efficient screening tests might reduce this diagnostic delay .|As endometriosis is presumed to be a complex disease with several genetic and non - genetic pathogenic factors , many researchers have sought to identify polymorphisms that predispose to this condition .|OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE : We performed a systematic review and meta - analysis of the most regularly reported polymorphisms in order to identify those that might predispose to endometriosis and might thus be of value in screening .|SEARCH METHODS : The MEDLINE database was searched for English - language publications on DNA polymorphisms in endometriosis , with no date restriction .|The PubTator text mining tool was used to extract gene names from the selected publications ' abstracts .|We only selected polymorphisms reported by at least three studies , having applied strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to their control populations .|No stratification based on ethnicity was performed .|All steps were carried out according to PRISMA guidelines .|OUTCOMES : The initial selection of 395 publications cited 242 different genes .|Sixty - two genes ( corresponding to 265 different polymorphisms ) were cited at least in three publications .|After the application of our other selection criteria ( an original case - control study of endometriosis , a reported association between endometriosis and at least one polymorphism , data on women of reproductive age and a diagnosis of endometriosis in the cases established by surgery and / or MRI and confirmed by histology ) , 28 polymorphisms were eligible for meta - analysis .|Only five of the 28 polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with endometriosis : interferon gamma ( IFNG ) ( CA ) repeat , glutathione S - transferase mu 1 ( GSTM1 ) null genotype , glutathione S - transferase pi 1 ( GSTP1 ) rs1695 and wingless - type MMTV integration site family member 4 ( WNT4 ) rs16826658 and rs2235529 .|Six others showed a significant trend towards an association : progesterone receptor ( PGR ) PROGINS , interCellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM1 ) rs1799969 , aryl - hydrocarbon receptor repressor ( AHRR ) rs2292596 , cytochrome family 17 subfamily A polypeptide 1 ( CYP17A1 ) rs743572 , CYP2C19 rs4244285 and peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPARG ) rs1801282 ) , and 12 showed a significant trend towards the lack of an association : tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) rs1799964 , interleukin 6 ( IL6 ) rs1800796 , transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFB1 ) rs1800469 , estrogen receptor 1 ( ESR1 ) rs2234693 , PGR rs10895068 , FSH receptor ( FSHR ) rs6166 , ICAM1 rs5498 , CYP1A1 rs4646903 , CYP19A1 rs10046 , tumor protein 53 ( TP53 ) rs1042522 , X - ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 ( XRCC1 ) rs25487 and serpin peptidase inhibitor clade E member 1 ( SERPINE1 ) rs1799889 ; however , for the 18 polymorphisms identified in the latter two groups , further studies of the potential association with the endometriosis risk are needed .|The remaining five of the 28 polymorphisms were not associated with endometriosis : glutathione S - transferase theta 1 ( GSTT1 ) null genotype , vascular endothelial growth factor alpha ( VEGFA ) rs699947 , rs833061 , rs2010963 and rs3025039 .|WIDER IMPLICATIONS : By carefully taking account of how the control populations were defined , we identified polymorphisms that might be candidates for use in endometriosis screening and polymorphisms not associated with endometriosis .|This might constitute the first step towards identifying polymorphism combinations that predispose to endometriosis ( IFNG ( CA ) repeat , GSTM1 null genotype , GSTP1 rs1695 , WNT4 rs16826658 and WNT4 rs2235529 ) in a large cohort of patients with well - defined inclusion criteria .|In turn , these results might improve the diagnosis of endometriosis in primary care .|Lastly , our present findings may enable a better understanding of endometriosis and improve the management of
